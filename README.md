## FrontEndMentor
![mobileCoverImage](preview/mobilecover.png)
This project is tagged as advanced in Frontend Mentor and it was really a tough one infact various things I did in this were not best practices at all. Its also my first time working with a form and should have researched a bit more but this one I decided to end today.

## Coding Map
![mobileRadioImage](preview/mobileradio.png)

1. I started with cloning the designs with html and css from the [frontend-mentor-challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges) .

2. The challenge I faced the responsiveness of the form and to choose what breakpoints to consider. This was achieved by css variables.

3. After that I started working on the javascript code for the project . Whole app is supported by a single eventlistener which is very bad as it causes some conditional issues and caused bugs all over the place.

4. However I worked out of it made it work as intended **THE END**

## Deployment
